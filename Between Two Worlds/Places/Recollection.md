### Notable Places


___
### Summary
Plane made of pure [[astrom]]
3 levels that get more dangerous the farther you go in
presumably infinitely in all directions and no end has ever been found

No stars until the 3rd layer

### [[Elysium]]'s Recollection
Several entrances exist on [[Elysium]]
Accessing Layer 2 of Recollection through Elysium requires approval from a follower of The Arbiter and getting into Layer 3 is reserved for only the strongest people across the globe.

Layers do seem vertical as the ring of return magic item made of [[Elysium]]'s [[Astrom]] allows for one barrier to be passed at a time with the level 1 leading to Elysium. 

In the past there have been events where people evacuate after big [[Astrols]] sighting. Party investigated a place where peoples astroms where completely removed.

Ruins have small amounts of astrom in the stones

[[Asphodel]]'s businesses are moving into town
[[The Gods]] cant see down here since they are not down here. Also they don't dare step foot in recollection according to [[Vega1|Vega]]
##### Interesting Bits/Spatial Anomaly 
- Below the ancient ruins is a magical place where the barrier between the 1st and 2nd layer is pierced. Currently being watched by [[E M]]. (Suicide if not prepared to pass properly)
- South of clocktown there is an illusion magic zone where a rando NPC (Gabriel) swears his friends got trapped in astral fight but in reality they were long dead underground (like dead for years) 
- Broken Down Church - North of [[Sight Alsward]] 
	- Destroyed church dedicated to none of the base gods.  
	- Area dims and there are Holes that go down and down and down (no oxygen in the hole). Extra dimensional space. You can dig underneath the hole just fine. Additional holes appear overtime
	- Moss/plants would be between 1000-2000 years old. 
	- Church was supposed to be dedicated towards any of the inside/outsider gods. 
	- [[Recollection Spatial Anomaly Analysis]]
- [[Twin Moons]] Pool - Near Second Axis
	- More colorful area that reminds us of [[Elysium]]
	- [[Astrols]] here were docile
	- Pond here reflects a moon that doesnt exist. Reflection persists despite going over it with boat
	- Underwater there's a second underwater moon at a deeper pond underwater. (there is also a manmade bridge under water)
	-  [[Recollection Spatial Anomaly Analysis]]
- Portal/Black Ooze Pool - Ancient Ruins
	- Path to the 2nd layer (or pocket plane) of recollection - Portal where people long ago discovered
	- Chaotic black goop pooled around the basin of this area

### [[Asphodel]]'s Recollection
One entrance that is heavily guarded. Level one here is about as dangerous as Elysium's level 3
All information on this place is confidential and its publicly claimed that no-one has reached level 2
