___
### Summary
Plane made of pure [[astrom]]
3 levels that get more dangerous the farther you go in
presumably infinitely in all directions and no end has ever been found

No stars until the 3rd layer

### [[Elysium]]'s Recollection
Several entrances exist on [[Elysium]]
Accessing Layer 2 of Recollection through Elysium requires approval from a follower of The Arbiter and getting into Layer 3 is reserved for only the strongest people across the globe.

Layers do seem vertical as the ring of return magic item made of [[Elysium]]'s [[Astrom]] allows for one barrier to be passed at a time with the level 1 leading to Elysium., 

### [[Asphodel]]'s Recollection
One entrance that is heavily guarded. Level one here is about as dangerous as Elysium's level 3
All information on this place is confidential and its publicly claimed that no-one has reached level 2
