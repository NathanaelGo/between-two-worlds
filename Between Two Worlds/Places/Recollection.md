___
### Summary
Plane made of pure [[astrom]]
3 levels that get more dangerous the farther you go in
presumably infinitely in all directions and no end has ever been found

No stars until the 3rd layer

### [[Elysium]]'s Recollection
Several entrances exist on [[Elysium]]
Accessing Layer 2 of Recollection through Elysium requires approval from a follower of The Arbiter and getting into Layer 3 is reserved for only the strongest people across the globe.

Layers do seem vertical as the ring of return magic item made of [[Elysium]]'s [[Astrom]] allows for one barrier to be passed at a time with the level 1 leading to Elysium. 

In the past there have been events where people evacuate after big [[Astrols]] sighting. Party investigated a place where peoples astroms where completely removed.

Ruins have small amounts of astrom in the stones

[[Asphodel]]'s businesses are moving into town
##### Interesting Bits 
- Below the ancient ruins is a magical place where the barrier between the 1st and 2nd layer is pierced. Currently being watched by [[E M]]. (Suicide if not prepared to pass properly)
- South of clocktown there is an illusion magic zone where a rando NPC (Gabriel) swears his friends got trapped in astral fight but in reality they were long dead underground (like dead for years) 

### [[Asphodel]]'s Recollection
One entrance that is heavily guarded. Level one here is about as dangerous as Elysium's level 3
All information on this place is confidential and its publicly claimed that no-one has reached level 2
