### Summary
It’s like the city’s soul is tied to the cosmos.
about 100 years old

Low City is basically the lowest, most impoverished area that you can be in without being shunted into the very outskirts of The City and being at risk of falling into the dead zones. The quality of life is low, people are crowded and there's a high amount of crime. That being said, people still survive and do their best to form a community around things such as the occasional backstreets bar or overcrowded hostel.

Coldsteel District is where most of The City's work happens. Most people in the city commute here during the day and during the night to attend their jobs and much of it is constantly under construction, always being built up to make the general work of the people more efficient. It's less crowded than Low city but still pretty cramped overall and people often find themselves unintentionally intertwining with other people's work because of how little space there is. Also, it's pretty polluted in terms of actual and magical waste so there's a non-zero chance that you get a horrible illness which would require a pretty penny to cure.

Central City is where most of everything else happens. It's the most general, easily accessible place in The City and is the most populated section. It contains most of the city's recreational activities and almost every single person in The City passes through central city at least once a day given its accessibility and variety. The quality of life here is, while not great, also not too horrible and it's far less cramped than the previous two sections and contains the largest portion of The City's housing.

Blacksteel District is where most of Blacksteel's operations happen and where all of the organizations attached to Blacksteel are located. It is a fairly high society where people's needs are met and it can hardly be considered cramped, perhaps even being spacious to some. That being said, it's still a 'purely business' district and is dominated by people of influence and those who work directly below those people and almost everything that happens here is entirely related to work and work matters, very little recreational activities available though not non-existent.

High City is where the wealthiest of the wealthy are stationed and also where Blacksteel's headquarters is located. There is an abundance of space, the most amount of recreational activities available and is the place that everyone strives to reach. Anyone who sits at the top of a company sits here and enjoys a life where all of their needs are met and then exceeded and a lot of the laws and jurisdictions that are passed are passed with High City in mind, people here having their hands in all sort of business, incredibly shady business most of the time.
