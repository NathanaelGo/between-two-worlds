On Elysium, bloodfiends are incredibly rare and in most cases shy completely away from civilization, doing their best to live as quietly as possible while feeding, albeit unsatisfyingly on livestock animals they may encounter across the plains. Elysium has made and is still making frequent attempts to integrate bloodfiends into society but oftentime these plans fall through one way or another.

On Asphodel, bloodfiends are exterminated on sight and without question or remorse. Their entire existence is seen as an upset to the natural order and just one more challenge that the planet has offered them that they must now deal with. Because of this, bloodfiends have been relegated to the depths of the city and their only real hopes of survival are by living in sewers and other disgusting places that no one dares look.
