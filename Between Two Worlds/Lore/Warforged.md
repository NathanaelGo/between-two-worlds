Manufactured race solely born on Asphodel

Serve a job on [[Asphodel]] for a small amount of years in service then are set free and allowed to pursue whatever life they want

On [[Asphodel]], warforged are used for the vast majority of labor and are not given consciousness until they have fulfilled enough of this labor to be allowed to leave. That being said, there’s still a large chunk that enjoy serving their predetermined purpose and so pursue those ends until they eventually shut down.

On [[Elysium]], warforged are free to do whatever they please, treated from the get-go as a regular race amongst other races. In fact, warforged are usually very well-respected members of their communities thanks to most finding more pleasure in serving other over themselves.
