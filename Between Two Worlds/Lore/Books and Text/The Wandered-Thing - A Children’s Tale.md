The Wandered-Thing: 
A Children’s Tale.

Passed down in whispers and warnings, mostly when the moon is a crooked thing.
There once was a child who didn’t sit the way the other children sat. When the others lined up to eat or sleep or listen, this one always stood at the edge of the line, twisting little bits of string between their fingers or staring too long at nothing at all. Not cruel. Not kind. Just... sideways. The way their eyes never quite pointed the same direction at once made the elders speak softer when they passed.

They never cried, not even when they were hurt. They laughed at odd times, like when someone tripped or when something broke. Sometimes they laughed before things happened.
People stopped calling them by name. Names, after all, are for things you can follow. Instead, they called them “That One” or “the Wandered-Thing.” No one remembered when they’d arrived. Maybe they were born from the wind behind the chapel, or maybe they were a leftover whisper from the wrong story.

The other children learned not to play too close. When they did, their games bent strangely. Marbles rolled uphill. Shadows moved before the sun did. One boy forgot his brother’s name for three whole days.

One spring morning, the Wandered-Thing was gone. No footprints, no note. Just a little patch of disturbed dust beneath the old bell. The bell hadn’t rung in years. It rang once just after.
Later, a child claimed to have seen them skipping across a rooftop, humming a tune no one remembered teaching them. When asked what they were humming, the child said it wasn’t really a song, just a line, again and again:
“Someday I’ll be gone.”
“Don’t be jealous of me when I’m resting in peace.”

Most adults say it never happened. That there’s no such child, never was. But when the wind gets inside your house and leaves the doors open behind it, they say that’s when the Wandered-Thing is passing by. Looking for somewhere new to be forgotten.
