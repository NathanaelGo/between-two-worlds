**Author:** [[Executioner|Exie]]?
### Content
So I ask,

Upon who do your tired eyes fall. Do they wear your colours, speak with your same tone, smile in the same way you do? Do they know the weariness of your soul, the aching pulses of your brain, the slowing of your heart? Do they know of the cruelty that they endure at your hand and of you at theirs?

So I ask,

Why do those eyes not fall upon me? Me who wears your colours, speaks with your tone and smiles in the same way you do. I know of the echoing blackness in your soul and the crimson stillness of your heart. 

Yet still your thoughts elude me. I know how but not why you do the things you do. So please, let me peruse your mind, witness your aching brain,

Before your memory fades.
