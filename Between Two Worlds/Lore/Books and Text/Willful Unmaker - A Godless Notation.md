The [[Deadzone]] is no place for even the quietest whispers of power.
I stepped into the hollow where light itself trembles—only to find absence deeper than mere void. Not death, not silence, but a hunger without name. It watches. It waits.

I, who shape ends and command wills, felt the threads unravel beneath my touch. A knot in the fabric too dense to undo, yet too writhing to ignore—like a serpent coiling beneath the skin, unseen yet ever tightening.

The shadows there do not obey. They shift like broken promises, and the air thrums with secrets not meant to be heard—secrets that claw at the edge of thought.

It is the space where what should be and what should not converge, a wound torn between worlds.
My will falters. It is not defeat, but something worse: an echo of surrender whispered by the abyss itself.

[[Sargon]], when these words find you, know this—what lies beyond is no mere death. It is a mirror without reflection, a god without name.

Do not seek it, but if you must, bring nothing but silence, and pray it finds you less curious than I.
The [[Deadzone]] does not forgive, it does not forget, and it waits for those who listen too long.

I write this with hands trembling, a warning not for my own sake but for yours. There are doors some gods dare not open—and I am no exception.
