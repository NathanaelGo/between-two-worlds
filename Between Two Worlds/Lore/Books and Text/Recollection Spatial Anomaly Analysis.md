In the beforetimes, Recollection was not open to public exploration due to it's supposed volatility. As a testemant to mankind's perseverance however, this was one of the first buildings built upon the realm, a general-use church open to worshippers of all kind.

It would not be long until an Astrol, stronger than should be possible for this step, came across the place and tore it down, leading to a battle which resulted in many injured but none dead at the cost of the church's exterior. Given that this event occured many, many hundreds of years ago, the place has already been scrubbed of much of its meaningful information and yet in this era, which is to say as recent as months ago, it has become the target of a curious spacial anomoly. 

While this sort of thing is not unheard of, for it to be of this extent and in an area that many are aware of is most certainly worth documenting especially due to the fear that typically comes with approaching such a place.

A tourist attraction of sorts at this stage, the moonlight isle is a small clearing in the wood around second axis that holds a peculiar mystery that none have been able to give any stable hypothesis to.

A pond, small as it is, that reflects the image of a moon that is not there.

~~Though I have no additional information that allows me to make any sort of good guess at why this is,~~ I find myself more interested in the fact that it has become an Astrol hotspot. Specifically, spiritspring Astrols, usually hostile when paired with other Astrols of similar power, tend to gather around the pool and float around, docile, their faint pulses singing to some kind of tune that we aren't able to hear without proper equipment.
