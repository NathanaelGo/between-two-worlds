**Author:** [[Richten Blacksteel]]
### Content
Curse that Blacksteel bastard. 

I have been unable to dream since then. Unable to die. This God-given, insanity-inducing curse must have reason. My devotion cannot be for nothing. I am not incomplete. If I am incomplete, someone will find this, making me complete. That blasted Snake will not reach me before then. [[The Arbiter|Arbiter]] be damned. [[Blacksteel]] be damned.

======================================
Snake is probably referring to [[Deathless Black Snake]]
Black steel bastard might be [[Kazic Blacksteel]]
