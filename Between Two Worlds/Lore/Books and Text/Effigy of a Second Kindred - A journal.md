Why can’t I stop thinking about the cards? Every time I shuffle, it’s like they’re whispering to me… like they know something I don’t. Not just some dumb game or distraction. No, there’s something in it... something tied to Him. [[The Bloodfiend]]. I’m convinced of it.

Maybe it’s all just in my head. But how else do I explain the way the cards fall sometimes? Like they’re guiding my hand, or showing me a path I’m too blind to see myself. Every cut, every draw, it’s like a message buried beneath the ink and paper and blood.

Other bloodfiends play for fun, for the rush or the thrill, to distract themselves from the roaring hunger. Me? I think it’s more—like the cards are a key. And the Bloodfiend is the lock. It’s almost laughable how obsessed I’ve become, but I can’t shake it. There’s power there, lurking under the surface, but it’s slippery. I keep reaching, but it falls through my fingers.

Sometimes I catch myself wondering if the obsession is a curse. Or maybe a call. A call to something I’m not ready for. What if the cards are a way for Him to reach us? To touch the world through something as simple as a game?

I write this to remember—because if I don’t, the whispers might drown me out entirely. The blood runs deep in these games, deeper than anyone knows. And maybe that’s the real reason I can’t stop playing.

Keep watching the cards, [[Malachar]]. Keep watching. Because whatever’s hiding there… it’s waiting. And it’s patient. Just don’t forget about me.
