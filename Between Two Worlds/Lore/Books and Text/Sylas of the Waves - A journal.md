I saw it — I truly did. A Scholar’s Paradise, floating far above the Ancient Basin, like a thought that refused to fall. They said it was a myth, a fever dream of mad [[Astrolabe]] cartographers who stared too long into the sky. But the wind carried me true, and the sea parted just long enough for the path to open: a spire of crystal spray and clouds, leading me higher than any storm could reach.

It wasn’t a city, nor a library in any traditional sense. The island floats — serene, massive, anchored to nothing but will — its surface a tapestry of moss-covered obelisks, stone seats weathered by minds that came before, and pools of still water where spoken questions never echo. No walls. No guardians. Only understanding, waiting in stillness.

There were no scholars. Not in the way I expected. Just echoes, conversations looping on invisible winds, words left behind by thinkers too curious to die properly. I stayed for three days. Didn’t eat, didn’t sleep. Just listened. Learned. Felt small.

And I wrote this, mostly so I’d remember something real. Not everything in the world wants to be found — but knowledge? It waits. Patient, hungry, and impossibly vast. I’ll be back, I think. When I’m wiser. Or maybe when I’ve finally got a question worth asking. 

If you’re reading this… don’t look for roads. Paradise doesn’t exist in a place you can map. It waits only for those who don’t ask where it is, but why they need to find it. And if it lets you in, write something worthy of staying there.
