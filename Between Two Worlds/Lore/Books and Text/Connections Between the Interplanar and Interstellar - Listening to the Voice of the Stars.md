You know, stars aren’t just pretty dots—they actually tell stories. On both Elysium and Asphodel, the sky is like this living, breathing map that’s always changing with the pulse of [[Astrom]].

Over on [[Elysium]], the constellations come straight out of old legends. Sometimes they seem to flicker between being real and magical. And those twin moons? They move in this quiet, perfect rhythm, marking magical cycles and big events. People there really watch the skies closely—because the stars sometimes hint at storms or big changes, both natural and magical.

Asphodel’s night feels heavier and darker, with fewer stars but ones that shine way sharper. The city’s got this tough vibe, and its stars kinda reflect that—harsh and unforgiving. Plus, the glow from [[The City|Blacksteel]]’s giant forges is so bright, some say it almost competes with the stars themselves. It’s like the city’s soul is tied to the cosmos.

But wait, there’s more—beyond these worlds are places where the sky gets totally wild:
The [[Feywild]]’s sky is like a constantly shifting kaleidoscope—stars flicker like mischievous spirits, and the constellations change like moods. Time there flows weirdly, and the sky can change in an instant, depending on someone’s wish or broken promise. Trying to study it is kind of like chasing a dream that might vanish any second.

Then you have the Celestial Planes, which are all about perfect light and geometry. Their stars burn so clearly they can almost blind you. It’s a place of balance, where creation and destruction play out like a cosmic dance—and if you’re charting those lights, you’re basically reading the universe’s rulebook.

Now, [[Recollection]] is totally different. There are no stars there—nothing to study in the sky at all. It’s like looking into a black mirror: empty, silent, and vast. Instead of looking up, people there look inside themselves, finding paths in memories and echoes rather than starlight.

And then, there’s the [[Deadzone]]. The stars there aren’t faint like you’d expect in some empty void—they’re way brighter and more intense. Their light’s so sharp it cuts through reality itself. But it’s not comforting—it reveals cracks in existence where time stutters and meaning falls apart. It’s like the stars themselves are watching you, waiting to see if you’ll stare back.

So yeah, across all these worlds and planes, astronomy isn’t just about looking up—it’s about understanding how everything’s connected. The stars hold secrets, warnings, and promises—if you can figure out how to read between their lines.
