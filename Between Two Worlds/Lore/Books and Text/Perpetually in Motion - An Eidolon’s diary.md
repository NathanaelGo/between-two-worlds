Well, that makes two.

Two deaths, I mean. That’s… not bad, really. I suppose the first time was clumsier. I’ve come to believe that my train of thought may prove to be my greatest opposition in these matters. With so much to think about… It becomes hard not to stop and smell the roses. Of course, stopping is another one of my enemies.

Perhaps it is wrong to desire something more of death but I do wish it had more ceremony. In a strange way, I feel entitled to something more. A soothing tune on the way out would help, flashes of colours I haven’t yet seen maybe, a polite note from the Arbiter or mine own God saying, “That was a silly mistake, Thryce.” Instead, I’d be much more inclined to call it a sudden pause punctuated by a lot of ‘nothing’. 

And then a lot of fuss from whoever finds me. Both these times I have awoken with people crying or shouting as if they did something terribly wrong by helping me. Though morbid, it is quite amusing that people try to allow me a moment’s rest after my revival when that is precisely the opposite of what I need.

They mean well, though. I will hold these individuals in my thoughts.

I thought that this time—after dying twice, mind you—I’d generate some profound idea.  An actual fear of death, maybe. A secondary purpose? No, I’m left feeling an abundant… nothing. Like I said, I don’t think that this is a bad thing. It tells me something about myself that I could only have discovered after a second revival. It also suggests something more valuable in the grander scheme of things. I’m still here, aren’t I?

I find these thoughts intriguing. Is it right for one who actively marches towards their own death, however slowly that may be, to think so heavily upon it? I suppose having no expiration date does make for an interesting perspective on things.

Anyway, I’m going to keep walking for now

If I die again, I hope it’s for something sillier. That or the completion of my task. Whichever comes first.
