Blacksteel: 
City of Lies.
Marstin Silversteel, 3727

Blacksteel wasn’t built. It hatched—a birth soaked in metal blood and fevered nightmares, crawling up from the guts of the earth like a colossal iron serpent with a thousand eyes and a thousand teeth that grind and gnash in the dark.

The city breathes—not air, but smoke and sorrow. It hunts—not prey, but the very souls foolish enough to tread its streets. Beneath the blackened spires, something twists and writhes, a monstrous wound that bleeds whispers of madness, clawing at the edges of reason and shattering minds like glass.

At the heart—if such a thing can be called a heart—lurks a void, a pulsating sickness that feasts on light and hope. It knows your secrets, your fears, your dreams, and devours them with cold, iron teeth sharper than any blade. It’s no god, no ghost—it is everything wrong with the world, wrapped in rust and whispers and the screech of tortured metal.

The forges fed it—oh, how they fed it! Flames that never die, smoke that chokes the stars, endless hunger clawing from the city’s veins like a cancer made of gears and iron sinew. And it watches. Always. With eyes like burning coal that never blink.

I have seen the core. Not a core, but a fracture in the world itself, a bleeding wound draped in iron and shadows that scream in silence. Tendrils of dark metal curl and snap like serpents—no, like serpents made of teeth and flame—seizing anything that dares touch the city’s soul.

Blacksteel is the serpent, coiled and ready to strike, ready to devour. It hungers. It hungers always.
Beware the quiet places where sparks refuse to fly and the machinery goes still. There, in the silence, the serpent stirs, its cold breath curling like smoke, whispering promises in a language made of broken steel and shattered minds.

Blacksteel is no city. It is a plague. A madness. A question that devours answers, and it is waiting… waiting to swallow you whole, down to the last breath and bone.
