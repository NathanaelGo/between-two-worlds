Potential Beyond Purpose: 
A study on Eidolons and their nature.

The introduction of the Eidolons into the mortal world remains one of the few acts of divine intervention that scholars across both Elysium and Asphodel universally acknowledged as deliberate, measured, and deeply symbolic. It has been just over a century since the first seven Eidolons were recorded appearing — each a wholly unique embodiment of the Arbiter deity’s essence, yet oddly… mortal in their own disinterest. With their introduction well received, the Arbiter paved the path for other Gods to adopt the Eidolonic system.

At first, the consensus among theologians was that Eidolons would serve as heralds of divine will, champions of prophecy, or vessels of judgment. Instead, what we received were individuals. Some wise, others listless. A few radiant with celestial power, others almost painfully mundane. One cannot ignore the metaphysical curiosity that there are always seven Eidolons per deity, and no more. When one perishes — naturally or violently — another emerges, often with entirely new philosophies, personalities, and powers. Early research into Eidolon succession patterns revealed no consistent geography, age, or cultural imprinting. They appear where they must, not necessarily where they are wanted.

Some among Astrolabe speculate Eidolons are not sent to fulfill divine purposes for us or even their God, but rather to study how we interpret divinity, much in the same way Recollection reflects our own histories imperfectly back at us. If this is so, we may not be watching the Eidolons nearly as much as they are watching us.

I must confess — with as much humility as a man clawing at the edge of comprehension can muster — that I do not believe Eidolons are merely divine agents, nor simple incarnations of purpose. There is a pattern beneath their randomness, a shape within the noise. Their appearances, their absences, even their deaths... they resonate like pre-scripted notes in a cosmic opera we were never meant to conduct. A boon, yes, but also a mirror — and I fear what may be looking back. The Gods may have placed them here, but I do not think they know what they’ve truly done. The Eidolons feel older than purpose, deeper than design. We study them not to understand, but to learn how to ask the right questions.
