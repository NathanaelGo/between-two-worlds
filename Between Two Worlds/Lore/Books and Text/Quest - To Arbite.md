### Content
Quest: To Arbite
A verifiably forbidden text has been taken from [[Elysium]] and onto [[Recollection]]. While there were other members of our faction that were tentatively willing to deal with this issue, we have ultimately decided to leave it with you under the strict belief that you will not peruse the text's contents. This will build trust between your group and ours as well as save our currently very precious time.

Directly south of the crossroad leading into Sight Alsward is a building named Allsight that sits upon a hill. This building has been vacant for quite some time due to its unfortunate placement, being that it is an Astrol hotspot of sorts.  Luckily for you, we have already hired someone to deal with that problem and now what we seek is someone to enter the building proper. This is where you come in.

You are searching for a man named [[Richten Blacksteel]] and the journal that he holds with him. While we do not condone murder in missions such as this, the actions of this man would most certainly lead to execution under the Arbiter's will and so you may do what you want with him. Ultimately, all you need to do is recover any journals or parchments he may have in his possession and return them to a member of the Arbiters of will.
