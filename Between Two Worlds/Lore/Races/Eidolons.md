Manufactured by the Gods and introduced onto their respective worlds after society and civilization had already been long established. 
Eidolons live incredibly varying lifespans, naturally dying only when whatever purpose has been imparted upon them has been fulfilled and living endlessly until then or they are killed. 

It has been well documented that any one God only ever has seven eidolons alive at one time and that the moment one of them dies via fulfilling their purpose or through other means, another is created within the next hour and implanted upon the world. They are more in tune with [[Astrom]] than any race has ever been and can ever truly hope to be but this does not necessarily entail great power or ability, often leading to them just being scholarly people who mix better with other scholars.

Eidolon's do not have to fulfill their given purpose. They have no instinct or obligation towards doing so and some eidolons, despite being revered as agents of God, just end up living incredibly normal lives.

Bodies dont last after death


One of the crueler tasks was to drink water - that one lived for seven days and died happy accomplishing what they wanted to - source [[Astero]]

Can exist before being born - doesn't count towards the Eidolon total
