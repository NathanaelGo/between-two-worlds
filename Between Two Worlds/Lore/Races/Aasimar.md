After [[Elysium]] was built, the aasimar, with a desire to do not much more than create and create moved to another bolder now known as [[Asphodel]]. They had a much rougher time creating [[Asphodel]] due to the [[Astrols]] which they were not immune to and so made a deal with the currently known [[The Gods|outsiders]] to protect them while they worked. The [[Blacksteel]] family was born from one of the old aasimar and the city was created in turn. 

The story that you would know of the Aasimar is as above, however, at some unspecified time, all of the Aasimar who were still alive began to tweak out and so the entire race had to be put down. The most you'd really know about the time and date is that it happened a long long time ago

[[Bloodfiends]] are a corrupted strain of aasimar
