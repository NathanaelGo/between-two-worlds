Astrom is commonly associated with the soul, things having abundantly low Astrom supposedly having no soul and things having abundantly high Astrom having a soul.


Astrom tied to [[Elysium]] is used in magic items (ring of return) to create teleportation circles that access that plane from [[Recollection]].
