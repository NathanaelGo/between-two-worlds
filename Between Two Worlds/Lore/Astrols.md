Creatures that are made of physical [[Astrom]]
Unstable ones fluxates astrom more 

### [[Elysium]]'s Astrols

Passive creatures not too dissimilar to farmland animals that we have in real life though typically much larger and far more respected. They can produce material to be harvested or can provide sustenance to many.

### [[Asphodel]]'s Astrols

Incredibly dangerous creatures that incite violence and chaos
They are the leading cause of the Deadzones of Asphodel and make it an incredibly harsh environment to live in. They are presumably passive and many of their horrific qualities seem to be no fault of their own.

### [[Recollection]]'s Astrols

They seem to have been meticulously designed for combat, protecting the plane with their lives and ensuring that any inexperienced adventurers cannot access the lower levels of Recollection. 
Reproduce at an incredibly fast rate, making it such that no amount of attempted genocide could possibly work against them. Astrols in Recollection are classified based on their levels of danger and the further you descend into Recollection, the more dangerous they tend to get. Occasionally, an Astrol from Recollection may find itself on Elysium or Asphodel which comes with a whole new list of issues.
