### Summary

Only 'god' with out [[Eidolons]] 

Domain: Outsider - Hopelessness, Despair, Loss, Redemption
Worship: In the case that one finds themselves questioning the validity of their God’s authority, they may incidentally find themselves in the care of the Specter. Worshiping the Specter is not a choice people make actively, it just happens.
Miscellaneous: Near all of the Specter’s “followers” are on Asphodel given the extremes that the other Outsiders present. The Specter is the only God with no clear form and lacks many of the qualities shared by every other God.
