### Summary


Domain: Outsider - Blood, Life, Trade, Pain
Worship: Only the insane and the wicked choose to willingly worship the Bloodfiend, the vast majority of its followers having been forced into the position through profane deals and pacts personally tended to by the Bloodfiend themself.
Miscellaneous: The most openly despised God of all, worship of the Bloodfiend is outright banned in a lot of places and Asphodel has made a point to kill most kindred Bloodfiends on sight.
