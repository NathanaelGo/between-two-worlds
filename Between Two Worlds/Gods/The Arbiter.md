### Summary


Domain: Outsider - Death, Domination, Power, Knowledge
Worship: Few dare to dedicate themselves to the Arbiter but those who do tend to quickly find themselves in positions of grandeur and great influence all at the cost of being a plaything to the Arbiter.  
Miscellaneous: The least worshiped God, the Arbiter is an incredibly useful yet overwhelmingly intimidating force of nature to most people. The Arbiter’s form represents this and has only become recently known: a crow with thousands of eyes.
