### Designations
Member of [[Honeycomb]]
[[Eidolons|Eidolon]] of [[The Arbiter]]

### Current Location


___
### Summary
1729 years old
Seeks fun above all else, making frequent bets with [[N Ko|N]] and others that frequently relate to 'information', stuff like 'this will happen when this happens' or 'this person will pass through here at this time', all bets that she makes and wins nigh one hundred percent of the time

Pertinently keeps track of _everyone_ moving to and from the planets no matter what means they choose to do so by. [[BREAD Co]] reports even get sent to her!

Has her eyes on all [[Eidolons]] she can and reports to [[The Arbiter]] and [[Blacksteel]]

Knows what we asked for commune

Not a single [[Eidolons|Eidolon]] of [[The Arbiter]] or [[Arbiters of Will]] that aligns with her. Self proclaimed dark horse. 'Purpose' is to go against the grain

She sees everything better than anyone.

Has property on [[Elysium]] [[Asphodel]] and [[Recollection]] (not first step)
Painfully Loyal to [[The Arbiter]], made with freedom in mind
Spent her first 5 years with the arbiter until she was ready to be shown off 
No hopes, no dreams, just here to be free

AC 23
Reaction Counterspell + prevent that spell from being cast until the next long rest (if used multiple times it only blocks the latest spell)
Legendary Resistance
