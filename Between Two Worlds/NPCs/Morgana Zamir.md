### Designations
[[Bloodfiends]]

### Current Location


___
### Summary
Met with [[Ellis Clock]] about something
Hired the party for 500g to kill a member of [[Fang Hunt]] (in reality they knew it was supposed to be [[Duo]])
Left [[Sight Alsward]] in a straight line south after we failed her quest to kill [[Varen]]
Planned on walking out of [[Recollection]]

Kill someone after the [[Sight Alsward]] blood fiend divination spell ended and convinced [[Ellis Clock]] to not kill her 

Looked into something she shouldnt have (something far worse than [[Mars]])

Had to deal with first and second kindred stuff orders

On the run

Vague Hint: It has nothing to do with blood fiends - take a look at everyone else and we'll see a pattern.
