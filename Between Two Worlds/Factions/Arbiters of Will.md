### Summary
Small and obscure group
Appear when important decisions are going to be made 
The few times that they have interacted with events in the world, completely unraveling the predicted string of events until, unsurprisingly, that event was shaped to the Arbiter’s Will.
Unknown how people join the org.
That being said, they seem to always appear when necessary, be it to approve of written text on Elysium or to adjust and accept laws placed across Asphodel.
